# collaboration
sensenet enables collaborative content management, thanks to office online editing.

# Advantage
Being able to collaborate on the same document at the same time saves you time of emailing files, saves storage also, and prevents you from having to reconcile multiple versions of the same document.

# How does it work
You can edit the file as normally you do, and if others are editing the document also, Office will alert you of their presence. There is no special co-authoring mode and no command to begin co-authoring. You can open the document (word, excel, ppt) right in the browser and it saves automatically.

# Under the hood
To be able to configure this feature on the admin ui you need to have office online server and client side subscription.
