# Starting from Scratch

# Create a content repository

Register and request a repository.

<button variant="contained" color="primary">Create a new repository</button>

Next you'll need to model your content, create your custom types, and publish some documents to your repository.

# Try out sensenet with one of the demo repositories

You can start exploring one of our demo repositories filled with various demo content, just log in and you are ready to go! No registration required.

These environments are based on a daily build, which means all the built-in demo contents are reimported, the configurations are restored, and the customer created stuff are removed every day.

Just like with a dedicated sensenet instance, with these demos you can create, store, edit, organize and publish any type of content.

Now, let's take a look at how to connect the chosen content repository with your project.

# Include the dependencies

Let's add the following dependencies to your project.

# Connect to the API

<tab category="basic-concepts" article="getting-started" example="connect" />

# Configure your project

Followings should be created for using the API calls
