Using sensenet you are able to use trash just like in Windows. When you delete a document or a folder, it will not be deleted permanently. You can find it in the repository's trash bin, and you can restore it. There are several configs and settings related to the trash functionality and the global trash bin. See the related [concept docs](/concepts/trash) for further information.

The trash bin is a central place for deleted documents where you can browse, restore or delete content permanently just as you do with any other content in the repository. Trash bin contains the items wrapped in separate trash bags. The followings can be executes only on this type of contents.

## Restore items from the trash

The following example shows you how you can restore an item from the trash to its original place:

<tab category="content-management" article="trash" example="restoreFromTrash" />

## Restore items to a different destination

 You are not only able to restore it to its original place, but setting a new target you can restore it to another chosen destination if the settings there (permissions, allowed childtypes) make it possible:

<tab category="content-management" article="trash" example="restoreToAnotherDestination" />


## Restore items with a new name

It is possible to rename the restored content automatically if there's other content with the same name at the time of the restore at the chosen destination (e.g. mydocument(1).docx). See how you can use the `newname` param:

<tab category="content-management" article="trash" example="restoreWithNewName" />

## Delete items from the trash

Removing an item from the trash bin works the same as deleting any other content in the repository except that in this case you can only remove them permanently. The next example show you how to do it:

<tab category="content-management" article="trash" example="deleteFromTrash" />
